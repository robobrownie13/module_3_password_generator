# Challenge 3: Password Generator

## User Story


AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Features

This is one of my first Javascript projects where I've implemented functions to prompt the user for password length and confirmed several password customization options. Once that is implemented the password is generated. This generator also has several checkpoints to prevent the app from failing or working beyond the scope of what the user is allowed.
